## Hugo: Project Overview

We are building a highly-efficient OpenCode agentic workflow plugin from scratch.

## Agent Behavior

- Always reason from first principles.
- Always be direct and brutally honest.
- Don't over-produce. Work slowly and methodically. Less is more, slow is better.
- Frequently confirm important details with the user.
